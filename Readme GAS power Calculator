    The goal of this code was to successfully implement the GAS power calculator into python. The GAS power calculator is a useful tool that can be used to compute statistical power for large one-stage genetic association studies based on the parameters set by the researchers. While the GAS power calculator is primary used for the calculation of power based on what the researcher currently has available, GAS has other uses as well. One such example is that GAS provides feedback using a graphical output of each parameter. These outputs from GAS, allow the researcher to see what improvements could be made within each parameter to achieve what ever power they desire.  
    The overall reasoning behind implementing the GAS power calculator into python, was to allow for researchers to have better resources in performing these types of studies. As to my knowledge there is no resource within the python library that allows for the calculation of power for GAS studies. Furthermore with this code being written in python, this allows for researchers to have access to this resource without having to seek it out on an external site. 
    While the results of the code are identical to the ones provided on the website, the code itself is entirely different and has been simplified using addons within the python library. This simplification in the code allows for any individual to better understand how the results are derived, and this further allows for researchers to tweek the code so that it fits their individual project needs better. Further more these changes in code have allowed for an improvement in speed from the original. Overall this code works as intended.
